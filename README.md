# Scrap Mechanic Mapper

A little tool which opens a Map-Window and is able to read the player position from Scrap Mechanics memory.

All you need to know is are the memory addresses of the X and Z position. You can use CheatEngine for that. (Eventually this program may be able to find them for you without an external tool).

Good with multi-monitors.

*Still Work-In-Progress
